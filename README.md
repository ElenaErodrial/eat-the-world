## Introduction

Eat The World is a SPA.

The app brings information about restaurants around the world when the user specifies a city and/or a type of food.
The user can also register, acces to his account and select favourite restaurants that the app will save into 'Favourites' section.
It's possible to login and logout everywhere in the website, respecting the current view to return to.

## Functional Description

The app has been developed with React following the separate concepts architecture and introducing ES6 elements.

The layout has been done with SASS and has been following BEM rules.

Two APIs have been used: Zomato API and Skylab Coders API. The first was utilized to obtain data from restaurants and the other to obtain and save user data in a database.

Has been managed with Git and Github branches.
